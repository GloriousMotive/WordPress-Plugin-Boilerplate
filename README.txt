Here is a short description of the plugin.  This should be no more than 150 characters.  No markup here.

== Description ==

This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).



A few notes about the sections above:

*   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
